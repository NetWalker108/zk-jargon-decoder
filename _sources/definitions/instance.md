Shared inputs to both the prover and verifier of a [SNARK](def:snark) that support the statement to be proven. Notice that a [Common Reference String](def:crs) or [Structured Reference String](def:srs) are also shared by both the prover and verifier. However neither of these are specific to the statement and therefore are not part of the instance.
