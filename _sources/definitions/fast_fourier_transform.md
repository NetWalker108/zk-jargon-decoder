# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
> An algorithm that allows us to efficiently "convert" between two equivalent representations of polynomials: either as a list of coefficients (coefficient form) or as a list of evaluations of the polynomial (evaluation form).

*COMING SOON*.

<!-- ```{warning}
*Prerequisites: [Coefficient vs Evaluation Form](header:coeffs_vs_evals), [Lagrange Interpolation](def:lagrange)* and [Roots of Unity](def:roots_unity). We will not cover what the Fourier Transform is, or what it means. Instead we cover its use in zero-knowledge protocols and proof/argument systems.
